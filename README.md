# Kin Protocol V1
A high level repo to lay out a proposed governance system for the Kin Ecosystem

## What is Kin?
Kin is a token but more importantly an idea that was originally conceptualized by Ted Livingston and members of Kik Interactive in the white paper [Kin: a decentralized 
ecosystem of digital services for daily life](https://whitepaper.io/document/71/kin-whitepaper) The white paper lays out and idea to create a decentralized digital economy and shift the paradigm towards an economy of creators and developers and not of centralized companies that control the means for monetization for all. 

## History of Kin
Kin was promptly put into action in 2017 and through multiple iterations, ups and downs, nearly 6 years had past since the whitepaper was drafted and there was a small but vibrant economy of apps.  However, growth remained stagnant and the inital goal of decentralizing appeared to become further and further away.  This was due to a number of factors but at the center of it was that the company at the center, the Kin Foundation, was always the ones creating the rules and calling the shots.  The intial concept that was laid out by the whitepaper had assumed that the Kin Foundation was a temporary measure and would eventually automate their own jobs away and decentralize the governance. Alas, this did not happen.

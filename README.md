# Kin Protocol V1
A high level repo to lay out a proposed governance system for the Kin Ecosystem

## What is Kin?
Kin is a token but more importantly an idea that was originally conceptualized by Ted Livingston and members of Kik Interactive in the white paper [Kin: a decentralized 
ecosystem of digital services for daily life](https://whitepaper.io/document/71/kin-whitepaper) The white paper lays out and idea to create a decentralized digital economy and shift the paradigm towards an economy of creators and developers and not of centralized companies that control the means for monetization for all. 

## History of Kin
Kin was promptly put into action in 2017 and through multiple iterations, ups and downs, nearly 6 years had past since the whitepaper was drafted and there was a small but vibrant economy of apps.  However, growth remained stagnant and the inital goal of decentralizing appeared to become further and further away.  This was due to a number of factors but at the center of it was that the company at the center, the Kin Foundation, was always the ones creating the rules and calling the shots.  The intial concept that was laid out by the whitepaper had assumed that the Kin Foundation was a temporary measure and would eventually automate their own jobs away and decentralize the governance. Alas, this did not happen.

## Documentation
The documentation of the Protocol and Governance exists at TBD (put link here)

## Tokenomics
This is a formal path to decentralization and autonomy of Kin.

### context
There needs to be a lower level inventive system and structure outlined in order to move forward.  This should solve only for the problem of how the incentive system needs to be structred 

(insert chart)

## Staking
In order to cast a vote your Kin must be locked in the staking module and will be subject to slashing to rectify negative repercussions of governance votes.

## Incentives
To incentivize voting it is likely that a proposal must be made via the staking module to provide staking emissions.  This will likely come from a portion of the Kin reserves.  This will give smaller holders the opportunity to earn additional kin while having no disincentive to participate in governance.

## Kin Reserves
TBD

## Protocol Governance 
Changes to the ecosystem, whether it be the KRE or proposals to for Kin reserves, will be ratified through onchain Kin Improvement Proposals (KIPs) using the Governance portal. This process is to ensure extensive discussion is had on proposals prior to being pushed to the blockchain.  Any kin staked via the staking module will be able to vote on KIPs.

### Governance Process
KIP Creation &rarr; KIP Feedback &rarr; Signal Collection &rarr; Implementation &rarr; Governance of the Proposal

## Audits
TBD
